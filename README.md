# CritterDex Localisation

First of all thank you for helping with this. CritterDex is a PWA for Animal Crossing that allows players to keep track of the fish and bugs in the game. The initial release of CritterDex was in English only. I have since had requests to localise this in to various languages and that is now complete. One problem, I only speak English. That's where you come in!

I have performed machine translation on the other 10 languages (Critters and a few other things use official translations pulled from the game). I am in need of people to check the translations and submit corrections. To see this in action please use [the staging version of CritterDex](https://stage.critterdex.app). Thanks!

If you don't have a Github account you can still submit corrections to toaststudioinbox@gmail.com
